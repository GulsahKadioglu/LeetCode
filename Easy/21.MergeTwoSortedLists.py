"""
    You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

    Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

    Return the head of the merged linked list.
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
    Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
    
    Example 2:

    Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
    Output: []
    
    Example 3:

    Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
    Output: [0]

    Constraints:

    The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
    Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

# Dummy Head Node: One of the problems in dealing with pointer(variables that hold the memory address of another variable)# For a linked list, we use a head record to keep the location of the head and sometimes a tail record to keep that of the tail, 
# based ordered lists is writing code to take care of special cases. If we want to insert a node in an ordered linked list,
# we must take care of the 'special case'* of inserting this node in the beginning of the list. 
# *If a node is inserted into the beginning of the list, the pointer indicating the beginning of the list, head,  must be changed.
# Ä±f we want to delete a particular node, we must again also write code to handle the special case of deleting the first node in the list.
# For a linked list, we use a head record to keep the location of the head and sometimes a tail record to keep that of the tail, 
# but we usually don't use other records to keep location information of other nodes in the linked list since we can find them in the previous node.
