"""
    You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

    Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

    Return the head of the merged linked list.
    
    Example 1:
    
    Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
    Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
    
    Example 2:

    Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
    Output: []
    
    Example 3:

    Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
    Output: [0]

    Constraints:

    The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
    Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
