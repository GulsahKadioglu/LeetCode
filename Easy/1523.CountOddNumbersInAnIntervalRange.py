"""
    Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).
    
    Example 1:

    Input: low = 3, high = 7
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
   
    Example 2:
 
    Input: low = 8, high = 10
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
    
    Constraints:
    - 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9
